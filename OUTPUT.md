# Outputs

Generated artifacts live under `outputs/`. Each snippet should create its own
subfolder (for example `outputs/wallet/`) and write temporary files there.
Everything in this directory is gitignored so you can safely store mnemonics,
key files, and other transient data without risking accidental commits.
